The pun swapper starts with a column of puns on the left side of the screen. Clicking on a pun will swap it to the 
righthand side column. Also, the last pun clicked is displayed on the bottom of the screen. Clicking on the arrows
in the middle of the screen will randomly place puns into the two columns.
